It started out as a cool hobby to help pass the time and transformed into a bit of a monster.\n\nDestiny's third party developer community is a somewhat unique phenomenon and is very special. It enables great people to do great things, backed by community values. We build for everyone."

      "Info": "🦘 The long and skinny of it is that Braytech doesn't use cookies or any other mechanism to track you, nor does it target you for advertising purposes (I mean, Braytech doesn't have any ads).\n\nIf you have any questions further to the point of this notice, feel free to jump into the [Discord](https://discord.bray.tech).",
      "Policy": "🦘 1.  Introduction\n    1. For all purposes, this English language version of this Privacy Policy shall be the original, governing instrument, and understanding of the parties. In the event of any conflict between this English language version of this Privacy Policy and any subsequent translation into any other language, this English language version shall govern and control.\n    2. Braytech is a free fan made service for Destiny 2, the video game. This privacy policy explains how your data is used by this application.\n    3. Braytech is constantly improving, and the developer may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in their privacy practices. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically and to check the date at the end of the Privacy Policy for the most recent version.\n    4. Herein, the \"developer\" refers to Tom Chapman.\n2. Information the developer collects\n    1. Information provided by You\n        1. Your platform specific profile name is used to load and display your Destiny profile. At no point are your private credentials collected or used.\n        2. Patrons of Braytech may also optionally provide their email address as a means to associate their Destiny profile with their Patreon account in order to receive the appropriate flair for their Patreon pledge.\n    2. Information the developer automatically collects\n        1. Data regarding your usage of the services provided including your IP address, geographical location, browser name and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views, and navigation paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency, and pattern of your service use.\n3. How your personal data is used\n    1. Destiny and Bungie account info\n        1. In order to display and manipulate Destiny game information, Braytech uses the Bungie.net API. The only information Braytech receives, or has access to, is your game information (items, characters, etc.) and basic account information including your Bungie.net membership ID, and the identifiers of any linked services such as your public PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, Stadia, Blizzard, or Bungie.net usernames. The developer does not have access to your email, name, address, payment information, or any other personal information held by Bungie or the game platforms.\n        2. Use of the Bungie.net API is governed by the [Terms of Use](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/Terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/PrivacyPolicy) for Bungie.net.\n    2. Patreon\n        1. The data provided by you, the user, for the purpose of associating your Destiny profile with your Patreon account is only ever used for that fact, stored securely through Voluspa.\n    3. Usage data\n        1. This usage data may be processed for the purposes of analysing the use of the website and services. The legal basis for this processing is your consent or our legitimate interests, namely monitoring and improving our website and services.\n    4. Braytech settings sync\n        1. Voluspa enables a Braytech feature which allows you, the user, to store your data (Braytech settings) and sync it between instances of Braytech. This information is only accessible to you and the developer.\n\nLast updated Wednesday, May 19, 2021."
