The data provided by you, the user, for the purpose of associating your Destiny profile with your Patreon account is only ever used for that fact, stored securely through Voluspa.\n    3. Usage data\n        1. This usage data may be processed for the purposes of analysing the use of the website and services. The legal basis for this processing is your consent or our legitimate interests, namely monitoring and improving our website and services.\n    4. Braytech settings sync\n        1. Voluspa enables a Braytech feature which allows you, the user, to store your data (Braytech settings) and sync it between instances of Braytech. This information is only accessible to you and the developer.\n\nLast updated Wednesday, May 19, 2021.",

It's always being refined and expanded.\n\nNeed to find something quick? Press  and start typing! Braytech has a search HUD, available anywhere in the app.\n\nBraytech is built for desktop users first, but functions as well and looks as beautiful on smaller devices.
