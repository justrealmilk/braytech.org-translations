Every few days, _VOLUSPA_ collects data from users of _Braytech_ and takes note of who's got what.\n\nIt's been a hot topic as to whether it's accurate or useful and the truth is that all statistics are useless and dumb _unless_ you've included every single piece of data possible.\n\nIt's fair to assume that these stats are bias towards casual players (percentages may appear higher rather than lower due to the skill and attention of the users that are monitored).",
  "FAQ.Answers.0.Q": "Describing the anatomy of collectibles and records",
  "FAQ.Answers.1.A": "From the _Settings_ view, you can try a variety of things. Start with _Update service worker_. Wait a small time and you should be prompted to reload.\n\nIf this fails, you can try refreshing the app by selecting _Reload_. If the problem continues to persist please select _Dump service worker_.\n\n_For the technically inclined, Braytech uses a service worker and sometimes they're fussy._",
  "FAQ.Answers.1.Q": "Braytech won't update to the newest version",
  "FAQ.Answers.2.A": "For Valor rank resets, Braytech only counts resets made in Season 4 (Forsaken release) and later. This aligns the stat with other metrics such as Infamy.\n\nAdditionally, for the most part, triumph records disregard earlier seasons as well. This is a choice I made for Braytech.\n\nIf for some reason your stats don't align with your expectations, there's a likely chance that this is a reflection of the API, not Braytech.",
  "FAQ.Answers.2.Q": "Something seems wrong with my Valor rank resets",
  "FAQ.Answers.3.A": "There are multiple sources for stats in Destiny. Clan Historical Stats is based on the HistoricalStats API endpoint while others source their data from PGCRs. It's hard to determine which holds the most accurate truth.\n\nTo display stats in the manner seen on Clan Historical Stats would require downloading terabytes of data from Bungie servers and significant compute power.

  "Landing.About.What": "Braytech is an app and it wants to be your best Destiny sidekick.\n\nBraytech's features include _Clan_, _Collections_, _Triumphs_, _Trackers_, _Checklists_, _Maps_, _Quests_, _Reports_, as well as curated and customisable views.\n\nJust as Destiny is a game for all Guardians, available in various languages, so is Braytech. It's beautiful on both desktop computers and smaller touch devices, accessible by anyone from anywhere.\n\nThe name, Braytech, is that which Clovis Bray, one of several of the franchise's fictional entities, designates their consumer products line; weapons, armour, etc. As such, I thought it fitting as a name for what I endeavour to be one of Destiny's best third-party resources.",
  "Landing.About.Who": "Hi, my name's Tom, and I'm addicted to Destiny. Okay, so not addicted—I've had time to build this web app. Truthfully, I'm an avid Destiny enthusiast who needs both an outlet for letting off steam and for developing my web skills further for use in my professional activities.\n\nBraytech is a stringent exercise in mimicry—and to a small degree, reimagining—Destiny's UI for web and mobile. This has been my first React project, the first time I've heavily used the command line, the first time I've had to use NPM... And it's been super fun and rewarding, most of the time!",

  "Landing.Support": "Building these beautiful interfaces and fencing with Bungie's APIs takes effort and time. I can only devote so much of it to hobby ventures, which also cost money to keep online. I have a firm stance against ads on web sites as we know them. As such, I prefer to support these projects out of my own pocket and depend on the generosity of my community.\n\nBy supporting me, you can help ensure that I can keep these projects online, as well as help enable me to continue adding cool new features.",
  "Landing.VOLUSPA": "For the most part, Braytech is a simple front-end application. Although, beneath lies VOLUSPA, named after of one of _Rasputin's_ subminds. VOLUSPA records user profiles' unique identifier and regularly collates statistics based upon them. These statistics are displayed throughout the app in the form of record and collectible _commonality_—the term I've given the statistics that denotes how common a collectible or record is between players.",
